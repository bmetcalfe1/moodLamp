    <div class="about-story">
      <p>ScribeLytics was created over a period of 10 days for our group's final project as part of the DecodeMTL programming bootcamp. ScribeLytics is built on top of the IBM Watson API with MongoDB, NodeJS, and Bootstrap.</p>
      <p>We originally began working with the Google Cloud Speech API. On DAy 4 of the project, we made the important decision to move over to IBM Watson. It was much easier to work with.
        From there, we designed a MongoDB database to store information, set up sockets for data retrieval and connection, and built a Bootstrap front end for usability. We hope you will enjoy!  </p>

  experiences, my main interest encompasses art, technology and sports.
  As an avid social dancer, PC gamer and volleyball player, I have always
  find joy in the journeys by achieving my best. Along the journey, I have
